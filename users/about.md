The main reason for this app is to create a custom user model.

I follow this as a start point:https://testdriven.io/blog/django-custom-user-model/

- use email as a main identifier - done
- let user got his own profile page - done

The users will be use in a later stage to create a newsletter list, maybe my own comment system and many other featured that may came to my mind an a later stage.

Ok, user model is done now.

Now, lets build the registration.

- user can register - yes
- user can login - yes
- usar can acces a my account page to view and edit his data - yes

ideal:

- user receive a email to active his account and after receive the email the profile is active - no
- user can reset his password - yes
- let user recover his password if he doesnt remember - yes
- user can delete his profile from my acocunt - yes
- user can change his email - no

templates

- login
- register
- account
